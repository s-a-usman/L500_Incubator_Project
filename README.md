# Smart_Incubator

This is a hobby project made during my internship in collaboration with a friend whose repository I forked.
It is an incubator project made with the arduino microcontroller that spins egg every specific time, consisting of a heat source, a DHT11 sensor to keep track of the temperature and humidity, and lcd display, to display what's happening.
This repo consist of the arduino code and all the necessary libraries. There is no hardware files, as we did everything DIY style. Enjoy!
